problem:
Still have the funny start game problem that I can't create in debug mode.  The end of the snake does not clear, snake just get longer, until you run over it. Haven't seen it in a while so I might have fixed it.
One way to cause it: Start game, don't move, lose focus, get focus and move.  Happens rarely.
