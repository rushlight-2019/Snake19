Problem:

Long: Still have the funny start game problem that I can't create in debug mode.  The end of the snake does not clear, snake just get longer, until you run over it.

Saw it in version 0.138

One way to cause it: Start game, don't move, lose focus, get focus and move. I'll active debug trace and I not able to get it to happen.

I beginning to think it a timing problem with it loose focus and pause.  They are not in the same place.
