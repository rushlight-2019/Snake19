0.135 14 Feb 2020 Select different keys to use. Not complete, but main keys work, numpad does not.

Select keys.  Change which keys to use in the game.  
Works for the keys one the main area.  A-Z 0-9 and -=\[];',./`
The A-Z will display as upper case when changed.  The game uses the lower case
But not the numpad will not work.  

Still needs work.  I went through 5 version to do this. Toss out 2 and returned 1.

----------------
Two versions of the snake game:
My Snake - hard to die.  
  Food increase Snake by 1.  A special food will get you more.
  My Snake Bonus:
    Snake can 'double back' on self.  

    Will not die if snake eat itself, could cause part of its end to die.

    Pass through Wall to other side. But loose X cells.
      Will pass through the walls so long as there nothing on the other side.

    Snake does not like to Turn so, so few turns and Food increase snake & score
      Too many turns Snake gets shorter

Normal Snake 
  Food increase Snake by 1.  Score +1 per food pickup.  There is a bonus.
    Will die if Snake eat itself, eat a wall.

  Select different keys to use.  3 tries.  works not complete need way to do numpad
  Save load scores/setting for Change of size
  Change size of screen.  default 30x40 in blocks of 5

Problem:

Long: Still have the funny start game problem that I can't create in debug mode.  The end of the snake does not clear, snake just get longer, until you run over it. 

Saw it in version 0.129, 

One way to cause it: Start game, don't move, lose focus, get focus and move. I'll active debug trace and I not able to get it to happen.
