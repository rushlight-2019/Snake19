Two versions of the snake game:
My Snake - hard to die.  
  Food increase Snake by 1.  A special food will get you more.
  My Snake Bonus:
    Snake can 'double back' on self.  

    Will not die if snake eat itself, could cause part of its end to die.

    Pass through Wall to other side. But loose X cells.
      Will pass through the walls so long as there nothing on the other side.

    Snake does not like to Turn so, so few turns and Food increase snake & score
      Too many turns Snake gets shorter

Normal Snake 
  Food increase Snake by 1.  Score +1 per food pickup.  There is a bonus.
    Will die if Snake eat itself, eat a wall.

problem:
Long: Still have the funny start game problem that I can't create in debug mode.  The end of the snake does not clear, snake just get longer, until you run over it. Haven't seen it in a while so I might have fixed it.  No, did twice since last upload. none since 0.127

One way to cause it: Start game, don't move, lose focus, get focus and move. I'll active debug trace and I not able to get it to happen.
