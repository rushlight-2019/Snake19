Problem:
Replay User Load if you don’t select anything, and close window by the upper right X.  Sometimes you get a program fail.  Saying Array problem. I need to rewrite the menu.

Long: Still have the funny start game problem that I can't create in debug mode.  The end of the snake does not clear, snake just get longer, until you run over it. 

Saw it in version 0.129

One way to cause it: Start game, don't move, lose focus, get focus and move. I'll active debug trace and I not able to get it to happen.
